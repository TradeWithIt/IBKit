 # Market data
 IB provides near real time (usually updates every 0.25 seconds) and historical market data.
 While some free datafeeds exists, most of data needs to be subscribed for a fee. Market data subscriptions are done at a TWS user name level,
 not per account. The only exception to this rule are paper trading users, where client portal Manage Account -> Settings -> Paper Trading allows
 you to share market data between your live and papaer trading accounts.

 ### Create a client and subscribe events

 If you run IB gateway in your local machine, the easiest way is to call ```IBClient.paper(id:)``` for paper trading or ```IBClient.live(id:)``` for live trading.
 Otherwise use standard initializer ```IBClient(id:address:port)```
 IBClient has three dedicated event feeds for market data, account data and system events.
 These data feeds are combine passthrough publishers, so they dont hold any values. Instead
 you create subscription and assign received events to event handlers...
