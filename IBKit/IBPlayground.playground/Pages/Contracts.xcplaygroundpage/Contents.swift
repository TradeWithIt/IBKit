 Most spot contracts can be specified by underlying asset, currency and designation exchange.
 For non US stocks, traded in multiple markets, you can use SMART as designated exchange and primary exchange.

Options, like futures, also require an expiration date plus a strike and a multiplier. It is not unusual to find many option contracts with an almost identical description (i.e. underlying symbol, strike, last trading date, multiplier, etc.). Adding more details such as the trading class will help.
